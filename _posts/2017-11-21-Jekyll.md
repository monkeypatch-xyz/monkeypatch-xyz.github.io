title: Working with Jekyll
---

While making this site I found myself looking at Jekyll and how to get up and running.
It was surprisingly easy, but it definitely has some caveats to get started.

<div class="toc" markdown="1">
<!-- Set class to title-->
  <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
  {:.toc-title}
  * TOC
  {:toc}
</div>

## Motivation
---

So for a while now I wanted to build a website, but I din't wanted to settle with the old Wordpress (WP) solution.
I understand that WP dominates the internet and has tons of support with plugins and communities of people devoted to it.

I wanted something:

* Simpler to deploy and host
* Something that could be hosted free or really cheap
* It should be customizable and I can make it look however I wanted
* Finally, I needed something only to host static content.

The solution: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

It was really easy to use and create a page from scratch.


The caveat is that you have to:

1. Know how git/github works
2. have a basic understanding of coding how HTML, CSS and config files work.  
- Knowing Markdown is a plus (everyone should learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) IMO, but that's just me).


In my case I knew how git worked so it was a matter  way that made sense to me.
