I've worked with some incredible people at incredible companies. 
However, the most fun I've has is while working with the Open Source comunity there is a wealth of knowledge that is open for everyone no matter your skill level.


### Also...

I am active in the Open Source Comunity and I always try to contribute either by pointing out bugs (creating Issues) or making PRs for the projects that I use.

Here are some of the projects I've contributed to in one way or another :

#### [ImmutableJS](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js)
#### [Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex)
#### [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
#### [HapiJS](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi)
