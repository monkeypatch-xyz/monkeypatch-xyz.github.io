Hey!, I'm Daniel Daza a developer and all around geek who loves technology and learning new things. 


I started this website to post my thoughts and work, but mostly it is a selfish way to keep track of what I am working on <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>.


Hopefully you'll benefit too.


These days I mostly write in JavaScript, but I am open to work with anything Open Source really.


If you find dee-lighted by any of these ramblings, be sure to let me know (use any of the social links the bottom).

Thanks!
